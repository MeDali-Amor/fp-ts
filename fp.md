## Funtions in F.P

-   Functions are transformations : they recieve and input and transform them to output
-   Functions are deterministic : map a value from the input universe to one and only one value in the output universe (every time we call a function we expect it to return the same value)
-   Function are Total (injection) : Funtions are defined for all the values in the input universe
-   Funtion are Pure : no side effects deterministic and total
